# Project Euler
This repository contains my solutions for the Project Euler problems, which will be written in Java.

All of my solutions will be tested to ensure they produce the correct answer, conform to the "one-minute rule", and are appropriately commented to explain my approach to solving the problem and explain the code behind the solution.

Problem descriptions are given as multi line comments in the .java files (which can be located in the *src/problem/pkg#* folder). 

All problem folders can be opened as projects in the Apache NetBeans IDE.
